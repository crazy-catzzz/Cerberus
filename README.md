# Greasy
Old-School themed Discord music bot.

This bot is just like any other normal music bots.
You can play, skip, stop, seek, take a look at the queue and much more!

# How to use

## Add to server

### Best way: Use the "Add Bot" button on top of this file

- Title pretty much speaks for itself

### Other way: Self-Host

This bot is hosted on repl.it so you may want to follow [the idiot's guide](https://anidiots.guide/hosting/repl)

Just create a Repl from this repo and in the `.env` file add these lines:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=nYOURz.kBOTw.qTOKENx_kGOESd-gHEREp
```

Replace the values with your actual bot token.

For the hosting part follow the guide.

### Usage in a server

Use the `g/help` command to look at all the features Greasy has to offer!
